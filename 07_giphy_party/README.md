## Giphy Party

Rebuild the [Giphy API exercise](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/intermediate-javascript-part-2/ajax-exercises) with React.

Once you finished rebuilding this application, include a "gif of the day", which should be a random gif generated, when the page loads. You **will** need to use a component life cycle method for this.
