## Forms in React

### Part 1

Create an app with a form that lets you add `divs` to the page.

Inside of the form you should be able to specify the `div`'s width, height, and background color.

When you submit the form, the div should show up on the page with the specified style.

### Part 2

Revisit your todo app from the events chapter. Create another component called `NewTodoForm` which should render a form that, when submitted, will create a new `Todo`.

### Part 3

With your todo app, add a component called `EditableTodo` which is displayed instead of a `Todo` when a todo is being edited.
